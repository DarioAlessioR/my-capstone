# Project Name: Capstone Project 

Description of the project:

This is a page created to fulfill Microverse final requirements for Module 1. The project includes 1 homepage and 1 about page, according to template provided by Microverse.

Instructions for the project specify that:

- You should personalize the content of your page. Choose a topic that is different than the one in the original design.

- You should follow these design guidelines, including:
Colors.
Typography: font face, size and weight.
Layout: composition and space between elements.
The pages should look almost identical to the original design. Small adjustments like text or image changes are acceptable.

- You can use a CSS framework (for example Bootstrap) for styling, if you want to.

- You should build only these 2 pages:

The home page.

The about page.

Each of these pages should have versions for 2 different screen sizes:

Mobile: up to 768px wide.

Desktop: 768px or wider.

Interactions

- Links
The home page should have a link in the menu to the about page.
The logo in the header links to the home page.
Mobile menu
When the user clicks (or taps) the hamburger button on the header, the mobile menu appears over the page.
There are no guidelines for the mobile menu in the docs, but you should implement it so it is consistent with the design (colors, typography, spacings, etc.).
The mobile menu should have a close (X) button that closes the menu.
Dynamic page

- The section "Featured speakers" should be created dynamically in JavaScript.

- You should use a JavaScript variable with the data about the speakers and use it when the page loads to create the HTML for this section dynamically.
